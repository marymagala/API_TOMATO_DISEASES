    "BACTERIAL SPOT DISEASE",
    "Symptoms and Signs
Bacterial spot develops on seedlings and mature plants. On seedlings, infections may cause severe defoliation. The pathogens enter plants through natural openings as well as through wounds. On older plants, infections occur primarily on older leaves and appear as water-soaked areas. Leaf spots turn from yellow or light green to black or dark brown
Disease development is favoured by warm (75° to 86°F), wet weather.  Wind-driven rain can contribute to more severe disease as the pathogens are splashed and spread to healthy leaves and fruit.

    "Copper-containing bactericides provide partial disease control. Apply at first sign of disease and repeat at 10- to 14-day intervals when warm, moist conditions prevail. Copper is strictly a protectant and must be applied before an infection period occurs."

    "Early blight",
    "Early blight is a fungal disease caused by Alternaria solani. It can occur at any time during the growing season. High humidity and temperatures above 75°F cause it to spread rapidly.",
    "The first sign that your plants are infected with early blight is usually the appearance of dark brown spots on the lower leaves. These are not just any spots. As they grow larger, they form concentric rings that resemble a bull's-eye, and the rest of the leaf gradually turns yellow. This disease usually progresses from the bottom of the plant to the top.",
    "Thoroughly spray the plant (bottoms of leaves also) with Bonide Liquid Copper Fungicide concentrate or Bonide Tomato & Vegetable. Both of these treatments are organic. If possible time applications so that 12 hours of dry weather follows applications. A day after treatment, remove the lower branches with sharp razor blade knife.
Do not spray pesticides, fungicides, fertilizers or herbicides when it's in the high 80's or 90; you can damage your plants."

    "Late blight",
    "Late blight Late blight (Phytophthora infestans) is one of the most serious fungal diseases that can affect tomatoes and potatoes. It is spread from infected transplants, volunteer tomato plants, and certain weeds botanically related to tomatoes. Spores of this fungus can be airborne and travel great distances in storms. Rain deposits spores onto plants, causing infection. Late blight is favoured by cool, wet weather and will cycle repeatedly if weather conditions are favourable.",
    "Late blight symptoms include leaf, stem, and fruit lesions that have a water-soaked appearance. The lesions eventually turn brown and the plant looks like it has been frost-damaged or blasted by a blowtorch. Unlike early blight, which typically begins infection on the lower leaves of the tomato plant, late blight infections seem to move from the outside of the canopy inward",
    "Spraying fungicides is the most effective way to prevent late blight. For conventional gardeners and commercial producers, protectant fungicides such as chlorothalonil (e.g., Bravo, Echo, Equus, or Daconil) and Mancozeb (Manzate) can be used.
Continue weekly spray applications to protect plants from further infection. Severely infected plants can be rogued and either buried or burned. Avoid composting diseased plants.
Rotate tomatoes with vegetables unrelated botanically to tomatoes or potatoes. Do not plant these sites with these groups of vegetables for two to three years. Avoid harvesting tomato fruits with visible disease lesions."

    "Late blight",
    "This is one of more than a dozen plant viruses that can infect tomatoes in both the home garden and commercial production. The virus is physically spread plant-to-plant by the silverleaf whitefly. These insects can acquire this virus in 15-30 minutes during a feeding period on an infected plant. ",
    "Typical symptoms for this disease in tomato are yellow (chlorotic) leaf edges, upward leaf cupping, leaf mottling, reduced leaf size, and flower drop. TYLCV can have a severe impact on tomato production. Plants infected at an early stage won't bear fruit and their growth will be severely stunted.TYLCV identification based only on symptomatology is unreliable, because similar symptoms can be caused by other viruses or various growing conditions.",

    "Mosaic virus",
    "The mosaic virus is a parasite that destroys plants, gardens, and crops down to their molecular level. Once a plant contracts the mosaic virus, the infected plant can then spread the virus to other plants and even affect an entire harvest if left untreated.",
    "Tomato mosaic virus symptoms can be found at any stage of growth and all parts of the plant may be infected. They are often seen as a general mottling or mosaic appearance on foliage. When the plant is severely affected, leaves may look akin to ferns with raised dark green regions. Leaves may also become stunted.",
